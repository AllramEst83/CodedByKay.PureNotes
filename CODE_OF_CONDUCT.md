# Pure notes Code of Conduct

## 1. Think About Future Developers

Write code with the next person in mind, whether it’s a teammate or someone joining later. Keep
functions simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.

## 2. Write Polite Code

Strive to write code that is easy to read and understand, so others don’t have to spend excessive
time figuring out what it does. This could involve simple things like adding extra spacing or using
clear, descriptive names for variables and functions.

## 3. Comment Thoughtfully

Add concise comments where context is needed, but avoid over-commenting. Even if the code is mostly
self-explanatory, a small nudge can go a long way in understanding intent.

## 4. Choose Meaningful Names

Take the time to create meaningful names for variables and functions. I know this can be
challenging (trust me, I get it!), but it’s worth the effort.

## 5. Break Down Functions Logically

Extract code into smaller functions when it makes sense, but don’t do it just for the sake of it. A
function can be long if that makes it more cohesive. However, if breaking it down improves
readability or avoids making the logic feel disconnected, go for it.

## 6. Take Responsibility for the Code

Take ownership of the code you write and any code you touch that someone else has written. If you
notice something that can reasonably be improved, either fix it or discuss it with the team.

## 7. Ask for Help

Solving problems on your own is great, but no matter whether you’re junior or senior, you’ll
sometimes hit obstacles that require help from outside your “coder’s bubble.” A tip from the coach:
don’t wait too long. Trust your gut—when the time comes to ask for help, just do it. We have all
been there or will end up there.

Additionally, if you’re unsure about anything, ask whomever you need to in order to get a clear
understanding of what you’re building. At the end of the day, you’ll be the one questioned about it
once it’s done. So don’t hesitate to ask questions early on—even if it makes you feel a bit
annoying. I know I can be, and that’s okay!

## 8. Pull Requests

When reviewing pull requests, leave constructive and actionable comments. Aim to provide specific
examples to clarify your feedback, making your intent clear. Good PR comments foster better
collaboration and understanding.

### Note

Let this be a guiding document, a gentle nudge for the challenges you face in your daily work. Let
us aim to create code that is both elegant and intricate where necessary. If we each contribute when
possible, the code will steadily improve over time.

These are my initial thoughts on how we might conduct ourselves when working with the code. Let me
know if you have any thoughts or suggestions about this or anything else.
